# OVERVIEW

IN THIS PROJECT WE HAVE TRAINED MULTIPLE TREE BASED MACHINE LEARING MODEL TO PREDICT THE DEFAULT VALUES ON THE LOANS USING THE LOAN-DEFAULT [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/loan-default).

FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE DONE INTIAL SCREEING OF THE DATASET LIKE LOOKING AT THE NULL VALUES AND DUPLICATES VALUES AND ALSO THE STATISTICAL VIEW OF THE DATASET THAN WE HAVE BUILD AN EDA REPORT USING THE YDATA-PROFILING LIABRARY WHICH IS QUIET USEFULL AND PROVIDE THE USEFUL INSIGHTS CHECK OUT ONCE...

AFTER THAT WE HAVE DONE ENCODING OF THE DATASET USING SKLEARN LABEL ENCODER AND ONE HOT ENCODING TECHNIQUES AND ALSO WE HAVE DONE SOME FEATURE ENGINEERING TO PRODUCE SOME USEFULL FEATURES LIKE LOAN-TO-INCOME RATIO 
AND CREDIT-UTILIZATION-RATE THAN WE HAVE DONE MODELING USING ALL THE TREE BASED MODELS AND FINALLY EVALUTE & COMPARE ALL OF THEM WITH EACH OTHER......

AND DON'T FORGET TO CHECK OUT THE [NOTEBOOK](https://nbviewer.org/github/MEHRAN-DEV-AI/LOAN-DEFAULT-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING/blob/main/loan-default-prediction-using-machine-learning.ipynb).
